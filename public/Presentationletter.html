            I had an experience as a volunteer, at the regular school where I studied, as a teacher of basic C+ and C++ programming languages, for use in internal and external competitions between students on the course for running routes.
        </p>
        <p>
            My effective experience in healthcare, hospitals and drugstores, focused on customer service, provided me with a set of skills to deal with different systems and people. I have skills such as good communication, quick learning, organization and optimization of tasks.

            I am confident that I can apply these skills effectively to contribute to the objectives and demands of the role, even without direct experience. I believe that my energy, enthusiasm and work ethic will be significant assets to success in this role, and I am determined to demonstrate this through my performance and dedication.
